# UKIEPC
Repo for practicing UKIEPC Programming Problems.

This repo will contain directories for problem sets from each year.

I will not be focusing any particular year, just solving the problems to build up my problem solving.

I will use a different version of Python depending on the ruleset for each year of the challenge set.
